ML0 :3 Crop Prediction (TRI-NIT Hackathon submission for team :3) 

Problem Statement: Predicting the optimal crop that could be grown in a particular location based on the
soil composition, rainfall, temperature and return of investment is essential for any
farmer of the modern world. This could not only save farmers from spending extra
money on fertilizers but also avoid the dangerous practice of growing the same crops
on the same patch of land repeatedly, which depletes the solid from its natural
resources.
